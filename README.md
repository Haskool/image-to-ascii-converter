# image-to-ascii-converter

# Synopsis 

Simple Java programme that allows you to select an image file and convert to monospaced ASCII text by converting each pixel to greyscale and mapping its value to a char.

Displays the image in JTextArea as well as an output text file.

Please note that for an appropriate sized ASCII output the image should first be resized to roughly 200x200 px.

Enjoy the ASCII art!
